\title{This function is used to read in user data in the form of a one or more flatfiles, default is TSV format.
Each file should end in "-ko.tsv" and contain a column of KEGG Orthology terms with column title 'KO'
and a column with their associated HMM or Blast E-values titled 'E-value'.}
\usage{
read_data(
  metadata_file = NULL,
  metadata_df = FALSE,
  kofamscan = TRUE,
  cutoff = 1e-07,
  delim = "\\t",
  custom = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata_file}{A flatfile with a required column called "filepath". The filepath column must contain the full or relative path to each genome annotation file; Note: files can be from different directories. A second and optional column is genome_name. It should contain the name the user would like to use for each genome. Columns can be in any order, and the rows can also be in any order.}

\item{metadata_df}{Metadata can optionally be loaded in as a pre-existing dataframe that contains four columns: genome_name, taxonomy, completeness, and filename. Default is FALSE. Can optionally set metadata_df equal to the object name of a pre-existing metadata dataframe.}

\item{kofamscan}{If the input file or files are output from Kofamscan, set this argument to TRUE, otherwise FALSE. Default is TRUE.}

\item{cutoff}{The desired E-value cutoff. Default is 1e-7.}

\item{delim}{The delimiter of the input files. Default is tab.}
