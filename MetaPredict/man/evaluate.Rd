\usage{
evaluate(.data, moduleVector = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Tibble object created with the read_data function - KEGG orthology annotation data for one or more bacterial genome annotation files.
#' @param moduleVector Character vector. An optional character vector of specific KEGG Modules to scan user annotations for, and optionally to predict for. Default is NULL.}
